description:
  short: Rectangular (4x3) flags in primary colours without outlines.
  full: |
    These flags and pennants are recommended for use in the US and elsewhere
    where square letter flags are used.
    The flags do not have outlines so should not be used on a white background.

    Flags are displayed in primary colours rather than the more natural
    default shades.
