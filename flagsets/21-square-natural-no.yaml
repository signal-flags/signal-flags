description:
  short: Square flags in natural colours without outlines.
  full: |
    These flags and pennants are recommended for use in the US and elsewhere
    where square letter flags are used.
    The flags do not have outlines so should not be used on a white background.

    Colours and designs have been selected to be similar to 'real' flags and
    pennants in common use.
